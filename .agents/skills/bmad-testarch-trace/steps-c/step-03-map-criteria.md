# Step 3: Map Coverage Oracle to Tests

## STEP GOAL

Create the traceability matrix linking the resolved oracle items to tests.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Build Matrix

For each resolved oracle item (formal requirement, endpoint/spec item, or synthetic journey):

- Map to matching tests
- Mark coverage status: FULL / PARTIAL / NONE / UNIT-ONLY / INTEGRATION-ONLY. `checklist.md`'s "Coverage Classification" section is the definition; **read it before classifying anything**, and apply the rule it turns on:
  - Classification is decided by what the evidence **establishes** about the criterion. The number of levels the evidence spans does not set the status.
  - **FULL** whenever every scenario the criterion states is established, whether that took one level or several. A criterion that one appropriate level establishes in full is FULL, not UNIT-ONLY and not INTEGRATION-ONLY.
  - **UNIT-ONLY** and **INTEGRATION-ONLY** are for the case where a _missing_ level is what leaves the criterion unestablished: unit tests only, against a criterion stating an HTTP status or a rendered state; or API/component tests only, against a criterion stating branch-level logic that needs unit proof. "The only evidence is API-level" is not by itself INTEGRATION-ONLY.
- Cite every mapped test as a backticked `` `path:line` `` pair, the form `trace-template.md` and `resources/traceability-matrix.example.md` both use. The backticks are the delimiter, so a path holding a space survives whole. An undelimited pair written into prose has no boundary but the file extension, and a path with a space in it is then read only from its last space-free segment onward.
- Record test level and priority
- Preserve each mapped test's stable identity fields (`id`, `title`, `file`, `line`, `level`, status flags) so Phase 1 can deduplicate unique tests before JSON export
- Record heuristic signals:
  - Endpoint coverage present/missing (for API-impacting items)
  - Auth/authz coverage present/missing (positive and negative paths)
  - Error-path coverage present/missing (validation, timeout, network/server failures)
  - UI journey E2E coverage present/missing (for source-derived journeys)
  - UI state coverage present/missing (loading, empty, validation, error, permission-denied)

## 1a. Tests That Name a Criterion Without Establishing It

A test earns its place in a criterion's `tests` array by establishing part of what the criterion states. A test that claims the criterion in its title, its test ID, or a comment, and whose assertions establish none of it, stays out of that array.

That is the rule for this workflow, and it fixes what every count derived from `tests` means: `tests.cases`, `coverage.by_level.*.tests`, and Step 4's live-only derivation all count test cases this trace accepted as evidence. The other answer, admitting the test and leaving the criterion at NONE, would have made the same numbers mean "test cases considered", so a suite full of mistitled tests would report level counts a reader could not use to judge where coverage actually sits.

Record every such test in `rejectedEvidence` against the criterion it claims, with the reason its assertions fall short. Carry the list forward for Step 4 and persist it into the progress document so a resumed Step 4 can read it. A reader needs to see that the test was read and turned down: a test that claims a criterion and then vanishes from the report is indistinguishable from a test nobody found.

```javascript
// One entry per test whose name claims a criterion its assertions do not establish.
// Shape only; the entries come from reading the tests against the criterion text.
const rejectedEvidence = [
  // {
  //   requirement_id: 'AC-7',
  //   test_id: '9-UNIT-014',
  //   file: 'tests/unit/pricing-rules.spec.ts',
  //   line: 112,
  //   level: 'unit',
  //   title: 'AC-7 applies the loyalty discount before tax',
  //   reason: 'Builds a cart and asserts the subtotal is a number. Never asserts the discount was applied, and never asserts the ordering against tax.',
  // },
];
```

## 1b. Attach Live Evidence

Attach the live records to the oracle items they name.

```javascript
// Read from this step's inputs when present, else from the `Live Verification Results` JSON block
// Step 2 wrote into the progress document. A run resumed here has no Step 2 bindings in memory.
const liveRecords = runtime.getLiveRecords?.() || progressLiveRecords || [];
const oracleItemIds = new Set(traceabilityMatrix.map((req) => String(req.id).trim()));

// A requirement with a fresh `fail` is a requirement the producer's own file says is broken. Counting
// a `pass` alongside it would let an appended retry overwrite a recorded failure, so the fail wins and
// live evidence for that requirement is set aside entirely. Producers replace records, they do not append.
const requirementsWithLiveFailure = new Set(
  liveRecords.filter((record) => record.disposition === 'fail').map((record) => record.requirement_id),
);

// A `counted` record that names an oracle item nobody recognizes is not coverage of anything.
// Demote rather than drop, so the report can name the id that failed to match.
const resolvedLiveRecords = liveRecords.map((record) => {
  if (record.disposition !== 'counted') return record;
  if (!oracleItemIds.has(record.requirement_id)) return { ...record, disposition: 'unmatched' };
  if (requirementsWithLiveFailure.has(record.requirement_id)) return { ...record, disposition: 'contradicted' };
  return record;
});

const countedLiveByRequirement = new Map();
resolvedLiveRecords
  .filter((record) => record.disposition === 'counted')
  .forEach((record) => {
    const bucket = countedLiveByRequirement.get(record.requirement_id) || [];
    bucket.push(record);
    countedLiveByRequirement.set(record.requirement_id, bucket);
  });
```

For each oracle item with counted live records:

- Append them to the item's `tests` array with `level: 'live'`, `status: 'active'`, `file: ''`, and `line: null`. They carry stable `id` values, so the existing deduplication keys work unchanged.
- Classify coverage on the same evidence rules as any other level. A live record that exercises the item's full behavior yields FULL; one that exercises part of it yields PARTIAL. Live evidence is not weaker per requirement; the gate applies its own cap in Step 5.

Do not set a `live_only` flag by hand. Step 4 derives it from the mapped tests, because a flag an agent has to remember to write is a flag that silently disables the gate cap when it is forgotten.

Records with any other disposition contribute no coverage. Carry `resolvedLiveRecords` forward for Step 4 to raise as blockers, and persist it back into the progress document so a resumed Step 4 can read it.

## 2. Validate Coverage Logic

Ensure:

- P0/P1 items have coverage
- No duplicate coverage across levels without justification
- Items are not happy-path-only when the oracle implies error handling or alternate states
- API items are not marked FULL if endpoint-level checks are missing
- Auth/authz items include at least one denied/invalid-path test where applicable
- Synthetic UI journeys are not marked FULL when no E2E or component test asserts the critical path and key failure states
- Items are not marked covered on the strength of a `stale`, `unverifiable`, `fail`, `blocked`, `skipped`, `invalid`, `unmatched`, or `contradicted` live record

### 3. Save Progress

**Save this step's accumulated work to `{outputFile}`.**

- **If `{outputFile}` does not exist** (first save), create it using the workflow template (if available) with YAML frontmatter:

  ```yaml
  ---
  stepsCompleted: ['step-03-map-criteria']
  lastStep: 'step-03-map-criteria'
  lastSaved: '{date}'
  ---
  ```

  Then write this step's output below the frontmatter.

- **If `{outputFile}` already exists**, update:
  - Add `'step-03-map-criteria'` to `stepsCompleted` array (only if not already present)
  - Set `lastStep: 'step-03-map-criteria'`
  - Set `lastSaved: '{date}'`
  - Append this step's output to the appropriate section of the document.

Load next step: `{nextStepFile}`

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.
