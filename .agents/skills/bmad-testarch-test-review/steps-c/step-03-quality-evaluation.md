# Step 3: Orchestrate Adaptive Quality Evaluation

## STEP GOAL

Select execution mode deterministically, then evaluate quality dimensions using agent-team, subagent, or sequential execution while preserving output contracts:

- Determinism
- Isolation
- Maintainability
- Performance

Coverage is intentionally excluded from this workflow and handled by `trace`.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`
- ✅ Resolve execution mode from config (`tea_execution_mode`, `tea_capability_probe`)
- ✅ Apply fallback rules deterministically when requested mode is unsupported
- ✅ Wait for required worker steps to complete
- ❌ Do NOT skip capability checks when probing is enabled
- ❌ Do NOT proceed until required worker steps finish

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Wait for subagent outputs
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: test files from Step 2, knowledge fragments
- Focus: orchestration only (mode selection + worker dispatch)
- Limits: do not evaluate quality directly (delegate to worker steps)

---

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Prepare Execution Context

**Resolve the run's unique timestamp:**

```javascript
// Headless: the orchestrating CLI states `tea_run_id` in the prompt. Use it verbatim.
// Interactive, with no tea_run_id supplied:
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
```

When `tea_run_id` is stated, that value IS the timestamp. Do not generate one beside
it. An agent with no shell cannot run the line above and will emit a plausible-looking
string instead; nothing cleans `/tmp/tea-test-review-*`, and section 5 below checks
only that the four files exist, so two runs that landed on the same invented value
would aggregate each other's scores into one report.

**Prepare context for all subagents:**

```javascript
const parseBooleanFlag = (value, defaultValue = true) => {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    const normalized = value.trim().toLowerCase();
    if (['false', '0', 'off', 'no'].includes(normalized)) return false;
    if (['true', '1', 'on', 'yes'].includes(normalized)) return true;
  }
  if (value === undefined || value === null) return defaultValue;
  return Boolean(value);
};

const subagentContext = {
  test_files: /* from Step 2 */,
  knowledge_fragments_loaded: ['test-quality'],
  // The single rule registry. Every worker reads severities from it and chooses
  // none of its own, so two vendors that agree on a defect cannot disagree on
  // the deduction it carries. A required input, not a hint.
  criteria_registry: '{skill-root}/steps-c/criteria-registry.md',
  // Measured in step-2b over the corpus OUTSIDE the review set. Convention rows
  // score against this rather than an absolute standard, which is what stops
  // "no priority markers" from firing in a repo that never used one.
  convention_baseline: /* from Step 2b */,
  config: {
    execution_mode: config.tea_execution_mode || 'auto',  // "auto" | "subagent" | "agent-team" | "sequential"
    capability_probe: parseBooleanFlag(config.tea_capability_probe, true),  // supports booleans and "false"/"true" strings
    // Rows M9, M10 and L9 need BOTH: the flag says the project intends the utilities,
    // the install says it can actually use them. Flag alone never deducts.
    use_playwright_utils: parseBooleanFlag(config.tea_use_playwright_utils, true),
    playwright_utils_installed: /* from Step 1: @seontechnologies/playwright-utils in package.json */,
    use_pactjs_utils: parseBooleanFlag(config.tea_use_pactjs_utils, true),
    pactjs_utils_installed: /* from Step 1: @seontechnologies/pactjs-utils in package.json */,
    pact_mcp: config.tea_pact_mcp || 'mcp',  // "mcp" | "none"; broker steps degrade when the tools are unreachable
  },
  timestamp: timestamp
};
```

**Every worker loads `criteria-registry.md` before evaluating anything, and every
worker receives `convention_baseline` verbatim.** A worker that scores from its own
sense of severity, or that consults repo adoption for an `Absolute` row, has broken
the contract this step exists to hold. A worker handed no baseline reports
`unknown` and passes its Convention rows as `n/a`; it never infers a convention
from the reviewed files, which would be circular.

---

### 2. Resolve Execution Mode with Capability Probe

```javascript
const normalizeUserExecutionMode = (mode) => {
  if (typeof mode !== 'string') return null;
  const normalized = mode.trim().toLowerCase().replace(/[-_]/g, ' ').replace(/\s+/g, ' ');

  if (normalized === 'auto') return 'auto';
  if (normalized === 'sequential') return 'sequential';
  if (normalized === 'subagent' || normalized === 'sub agent' || normalized === 'subagents' || normalized === 'sub agents') {
    return 'subagent';
  }
  if (normalized === 'agent team' || normalized === 'agent teams' || normalized === 'agentteam') {
    return 'agent-team';
  }

  return null;
};

const normalizeConfigExecutionMode = (mode) => {
  if (mode === 'subagent') return 'subagent';
  if (mode === 'auto' || mode === 'sequential' || mode === 'subagent' || mode === 'agent-team') {
    return mode;
  }
  return null;
};

// Explicit user instruction in the active run takes priority over config.
const explicitModeFromUser = normalizeUserExecutionMode(runtime.getExplicitExecutionModeHint?.() || null);

const requestedMode = explicitModeFromUser || normalizeConfigExecutionMode(subagentContext.config.execution_mode) || 'auto';
const probeEnabled = subagentContext.config.capability_probe;

const supports = {
  subagent: false,
  agentTeam: false,
};

if (probeEnabled) {
  supports.subagent = runtime.canLaunchSubagents?.() === true;
  supports.agentTeam = runtime.canLaunchAgentTeams?.() === true;
}

let resolvedMode = requestedMode;

if (requestedMode === 'auto') {
  if (supports.agentTeam) resolvedMode = 'agent-team';
  else if (supports.subagent) resolvedMode = 'subagent';
  else resolvedMode = 'sequential';
} else if (probeEnabled && requestedMode === 'agent-team' && !supports.agentTeam) {
  resolvedMode = supports.subagent ? 'subagent' : 'sequential';
} else if (probeEnabled && requestedMode === 'subagent' && !supports.subagent) {
  resolvedMode = 'sequential';
}

subagentContext.execution = {
  requestedMode,
  resolvedMode,
  probeEnabled,
  supports,
};
```

Resolution precedence:

1. Explicit user request in this run (`agent team` => `agent-team`; `subagent` => `subagent`; `sequential`; `auto`)
2. `tea_execution_mode` from config
3. Runtime capability fallback (when probing enabled)

If probing is disabled, honor the requested mode strictly. If that mode cannot be executed at runtime, fail with explicit error instead of silent fallback.

---

### 3. Dispatch 4 Quality Workers

**Every launch prompt carries the whole payload, written out in full.** A worker
launched as a subagent starts with an empty context: it sees the text of the launch
prompt and nothing else. Naming a step file is not enough, because that file
references its own inputs through `{skill-root}` templates that only this step can
resolve. Write all of the following into each worker's launch prompt literally:

1. The absolute path of the worker's step file, and the absolute path of
   `criteria-registry.md`. Never the `{skill-root}` placeholder.
2. The review set, as the same JSON array this run received.
3. `convention_baseline` verbatim, including `sampled`, the sampled file list, and
   the per-key measurement. A worker handed no baseline reports `unknown` and passes
   every Convention row as `n/a`, which removes those deductions from the score with
   nothing in the report saying a measurement was lost.
4. `playwright_utils_installed` and `pactjs_utils_installed`. A worker that cannot
   see them cannot resolve M9, M10 or L9's run-level precondition, and those rows
   vanish from the run the same silent way.
5. The `timestamp` from section 1, already substituted into the worker's output
   path. Do not ask a worker to generate one: four workers writing four different
   timestamps produce four paths section 5 will not find, and the workflow aborts.

Every one of these failures is a quieter score rather than a louder error, so state
the payload rather than assuming the worker can reach it.

#### Subagent A: Determinism

- File: `./step-03a-subagent-determinism.md`
- Output: `/tmp/tea-test-review-determinism-${timestamp}.json`
- Execution:
  - `agent-team` or `subagent`: launch non-blocking
  - `sequential`: run blocking and wait
- Status: Running... ⟳

#### Subagent B: Isolation

- File: `./step-03b-subagent-isolation.md`
- Output: `/tmp/tea-test-review-isolation-${timestamp}.json`
- Status: Running... ⟳

#### Subagent C: Maintainability

- File: `./step-03c-subagent-maintainability.md`
- Output: `/tmp/tea-test-review-maintainability-${timestamp}.json`
- Status: Running... ⟳

#### Subagent D: Performance

- File: `./step-03e-subagent-performance.md`
- Output: `/tmp/tea-test-review-performance-${timestamp}.json`
- Status: Running... ⟳

In `agent-team` and `subagent` modes, runtime decides worker scheduling and concurrency.

The four output paths differ by dimension, so four workers sharing one `timestamp`
cannot collide with each other. Two runs on the same machine could, which is what
`tea_run_id` exists to prevent: a value the caller minted is unique by construction,
where one the agent invented is only as unique as the string it happened to pick.

---

### 4. Wait for Expected Worker Completion

**If `resolvedMode` is `agent-team` or `subagent`:**

```text
⏳ Waiting for 4 quality subagents to complete...
✅ All 4 quality subagents completed successfully!
```

**If `resolvedMode` is `sequential`:**

```text
✅ Sequential mode: each worker already completed during dispatch.
```

---

### 5. Verify All Outputs Exist

```javascript
const outputs = ['determinism', 'isolation', 'maintainability', 'performance'].map(
  (dim) => `/tmp/tea-test-review-${dim}-${timestamp}.json`,
);

outputs.forEach((output) => {
  if (!fs.existsSync(output)) {
    throw new Error(`Subagent output missing: ${output}`);
  }
});
```

---

### 6. Execution Report

```text
🚀 Performance Report:
- Execution Mode: {resolvedMode}
- Total Elapsed: ~mode-dependent
```

`resolvedMode` is a run input, the same as the model and the convention baseline,
so it has to survive into the artifact. Carry it to step 3F as
`execution_mode`, which step 4 prints as the report's `**Execution Mode**:` line
and `cli/lib/parse-report.js` reads into the verdict JSON. A console line alone is
discarded on a successful run, which is what made a silent fallback to `sequential`
indistinguishable afterwards from the parallel run that was asked for.

---

### 7. Proceed to Aggregation

Pass the same `timestamp` value to Step 3F (do not regenerate it). Step 3F must read the exact temp files written in this step.

Load next step: `{nextStepFile}`

The aggregation step (3F) will:

- Read all 4 subagent outputs
- Aggregate violations by severity
- Calculate the overall score (0-100) from the deduction ledger
- Generate review report with top suggestions

---

## EXIT CONDITION

Proceed to Step 3F when:

- ✅ All 4 subagents completed successfully
- ✅ All output files exist and are valid JSON
- ✅ Execution metrics displayed

**Do NOT proceed if any subagent failed.**

---

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- All 4 subagents launched and completed
- All required worker steps completed
- Output files generated and valid
- Fallback behavior respected configuration and capability probe rules

### ❌ FAILURE:

- One or more subagents failed
- Output files missing or invalid
- Unsupported requested mode with probing disabled

**Master Rule:** Deterministic mode selection + stable output contract. Use the best supported mode, then aggregate normally.
